			Presence of God <br>in the Desert
		</div>
		<div class="text5">
			With the onset of Lent, we reach out to you as a voice from the desert. Throughout this time, we have felt upheld as we stand in solidarity with the suffering communities in the West Bank. Your prayers, solidarity, and affection mean the world to us. In this edition, we will share the initiatives we have undertaken, with heartfelt thanks to God and your unwavering support.
		</div>
		<div class="text6">
			In his Lenten message, Pope Francis speaks of the desert as a mystical place. Its ancestral inhabitants, the Bedouins, know of its beauty and harshness. Their resilience is inspiring. Life in the desert has strengthened them. They have little, and their needs are few. They withstand extreme weather conditions. They know how the flowers feel when they are “pushed and pelted”. As the poet Robert Frost says, “the rain and wind smote the garden bed that the flowers actually knelt, and lay lodged - though not dead.” The harshness of the desert brings unveils their vulnerability and resilience. They believe and hope even in periods of great aridity and drought. They possess an admirable capacity to recover and adapt in the face of adversity, projecting themselves into the future in a constructive and hopeful manner. They strive. They cling to the thread of hope that their heritage and faith provide them.<br><br>
			The solitude and grandeur of the desert reveal profound truths. It is there that God speaks to the heart. The Pope echoes two existential questions: "Where are you?" (Genesis 3:9) and "Where is your brother?" (Genesis 4:9). Amid challenges, adversities, and conflict, we feel privileged to share the journey with strong and resilient women in the Holy Land. We are inspired by the Pope's words: "Faith and charity lead hand in hand to this small hope. They teach it to walk, and at the same time, it is she who pulls them forward." Present on both sides of the wall, through service, encounters, visits, education, and training of women and children, we want to contribute to forging paths of peace and weaving hope in this Holy Land. That's why we are here. Thank you for your support and solidarity, and HAPPY EASTER!

			- "I wish the people of Gaza could also receive food

			We heard comments like these from women and

			In solidarity with the Bedouins of the West Bank, a,
			group of friends, primarily from Italy and Spain,
			contributed so that Bedouin families could have food
			on the table.<br><br>
			For the Bedouins in Palestine, the situation was
			already challenging before October 7th. But since that
			date, the situation has deteriorated even further. The
			closure of roads and the increase in checkpoints,
			especially in Palestinian territory, has caused many to
			lose their jobs and income. They are prohibited from
			building, traveling, and denied life opportunities.
			In a central location, amidst the open expanse near
			one of the Bedouin villages, the food distribution
			unfolded. Leaders promptly gathered, prepared to
			ferry the provisions to their village families.
			The distribution proceeded smoothly and
			efficiently, following Bedouin customs, all within a
			single morning. Prior to this, a Bedouin leader
			reached out to the heads of the 14 villages, assessing
			the needs of their communities.<br><br>

			"Every family is in need," echoed the majority. A total of 350 families across 16 villages were	served. Each household received a sack containing 20 kilograms of flour, 10 kilograms of sugar, 10 kilograms of rice, two liters of pure olive oil, and a jar of peanut butter cream—essential staples for	Bedouin families. Provisions were allocated based on family count, with some villages receiving 50 and others 7 distributions.

			you," expressed a Bedouin woman.<br><br> We are overjoyed to see that we were finally able to carry
			out this initiative, thanks, just like that day, to those who offered loaves and fishes. Could this be the same feeling as those who ate until they were satisfied when Jesus multiplied the bread?<br><br>	In our hearts, a prayer of gratitude swells for the immense	display of generosity from so many dear people. We also	hold the fervent desire that hungry communities may find satisfaction and that hunger-related deaths may cease. Our	hearts ache for Sudan, Gaza...<br><br>-"We have been eating hubaza (a dish made with wild herbs that Bedouins consume) during this time. At least we have this. But the people of Gaza don't even have access to

Nevertheless, in the depths of our souls, there is a prayer for the war to	end, for acts of solidarity to proliferate, and for those who hunger and thirst for both bread and justice to be satiated.

			The majority of women, young girls, and children from the 14 villages we regularly visit actively participate in the English and embroidery courses we offer. We engage in playful activities with them, as they learn through play and laughter. Laughter, in itself, is both contagious and therapeutic, bringing us immense joy to witness their happiness and smiles. Our aim is to provide support to the five kindergartens and various groups of women, young girls, and children eagerly anticipating class time. Since October 7th, these kindergartens have stood as the sole operational schools for Bedouins. These kindergarten facilities serve as safe havens, palpable in the comfort the children feel within them.<br><br>
			Utilizing recycled materials, Bedouin teachers are dedicated to fostering innovative forms of learning. These Bedouin teachers and the mothers may well serve as the cornerstone for cultivating a culture of peace in future generations.

			WHAT I HAVE KNOWN ON THIS JOURNEY IN PALESTINE
		</div>
		<div id="sec01_32" class="text6arial">
			<div>
				I am a retired Italian doctor, 64 years old. In January 2024, with the ongoing war, I came to live for a month with the Comboni	Sisters in Jerusalem and Bethany. I wanted a break away from home, I wanted to do something useful, and I wanted to pray for peace in the midst of the conflict.

			<b>Jerusalem, the Bedouins, the Palestinians, the desert, the biblical environment, the Comboni Sosters, faith...</b><br><br>
			Jerusalem is the most fascinating city I have ever seen. Wonderful, surprising sites await around every corner. Bells and muezzins' calls can be heard, various languages spoken, and people of	diverse backgrounds seen. It's exotic yet familiar,
			rugged. The privilege of visiting now, without tourists, is immense.<br><br>
			The Bedouins were a real surprise. I believe there is no other reality so closely linked to the Bible, both	geographically and culturally. They were deported
			from the Negev Desert and forced to live in	miserable huts, abandoning their nomadic way of	life. Nevertheless, they maintain their dignity in attire, hospitality, cuisine, and to the extent possible, housing. Community life is a reality, especially for children who are well-educated with both affection and strictness, appearing happy, always affectionate and welcoming. For women,	who marry very young and the pressure to have their first baby. Bedouins practice polygamy.

			Dominated by a sky of striking beauty, the arid desert blossoms after rain, adorned with flowers of many colors... It would truly be sad if such richness, enduring for millennia, were destroyed.<br><br>
			The Palestinians are the Arabs who live in this	land, both nomadic and settled. They are subject to	a harsh regime but seem to possess great resilience. I believe their ancient culture helps them resist, and	the warmth of family bonds strengthens the children. Their legendary hospitality is real. Palestinians are primarily Muslims, but also Christians (Catholics, Orthodox, Copts...). The tragedy of Gaza is just the latest in a long and	painful history of oppression and injustices
			endured. Will they continue to withstand the continuous attacks that threaten to destroy their culture, rich in values and teachings that are relevant for us today as well?<br><br>
			The desert is a place full of charm; especially the	light, the sunrise, and the sunset, are of a beauty	never seen before. The sky, usually clear but also stormy; the torrential rain and then the rainbow; the grass and flowers that grow in a day; the numerous animals, goats and sheep, donkeys, camels... A wonder!
		</div>

		<div id="sec01_36" class="text6white">
			The Comboni Sisters were indeed a pleasant surprise. I had never encountered such a modern order before. Their robust faith is nurtured by regular prayer and active, effective charity	work. Proficient in at least four languages, they swiftly cross	cultural boundaries, responding to wherever there is need. Rather than focusing on themselves, they prioritize the needs of the most vulnerable. They dress modestly, exude kindness, and strive to connect with everyone they encounter. I also deeply appreciated their support for priests and other consecrated individuals. Through them, I feel the grace of God in action.<br><br>
			How has this experience enriched my spiritual life? During my month in Palestine advocating for peace, I witnessed the living embodiment of the Bible in the Holy Land, visited numerous sites that resonate with the life of the Lord, and engaged in extensive prayer. I earnestly hope that the flourishing desert serves as a symbol of spiritual renewal, a longing within me. As the song "The Spirit of Christ Makes the Desert Bloom" suggests, we aspire to become instruments of salvation, aligned with Christ's charity. And indeed, the Spirit of God comes to	our aid.

			"I'm heading to Italy tomorrow, and on Monday, we have an audience with Pope Francis," shared Daniela, one of our dedicated volunteers. She and Clara join us on Saturdays to visit the Bedouin villages. We were thrilled to share this news with the four groups of women: our friend will be traveling to Italy tomorrow with a Franciscan delegation from the Holy Land, where she'll have the opportunity to meet the Pope. The
			Bedouins are familiar with Pope Francis and asked our friend to convey, "Ask him not to forget about us."<br><br> During the week, we spend our mornings visiting the nurseries, and in the afternoons, we host English or
			embroidery courses. Every Saturday, we venture out to four villages—two for embroidery classes and two for English lessons with the women.<br><br>
			In one village, the women craft beautiful scarves adorned with traditional Bedouin patterns. In another, they create small rugs featuring the word "peace" in Hebrew, Arabic, and English.<br><br> At each village, a sizable group of children eagerly awaits	our arrival. They spot us from afar and eagerly anticipate engaging in educational activities, playing games, and learning English. One of the children chimed in, "I know him, he wears white and gives blessings," while gesturing with his hand.
